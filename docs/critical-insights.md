## üéØ **REAL SOLUTION FOR LIVE LIFT DATA** (CONFIRMED)

**Date**: January 25, 2025  
**Status**: CONFIRMED SOLUTION  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

### ‚ùå **Why Our Scraping Approach Failed**

1. **Whistler Blackcomb Does NOT Provide a Public API**
   - True ‚Äî they do not offer official public API access to lift status or webcam data
   - Any third-party site displaying live lift status (like WhistlerPeak) is getting data unofficially

2. **Scraping WhistlerBlackcomb.com Is Extremely Difficult**
   - Their website is heavy with JavaScript and SPA-like architecture
   - HTML scraping is unreliable, and Puppeteer+GPT struggles with it
   - Scraping is unlikely to be how WhistlerPeak.com gets reliable data

3. **The Data Must Come from Somewhere: API or Embedded Endpoint**
   - The My Epic app and the official site must hit internal endpoints to get JSON data
   - These endpoints are often hidden but accessible if you:
     - Inspect XHR/Fetch requests in the browser
     - Or capture HTTPS requests in the app using a proxy

4. **WhistlerPeak Has Clean, Structured Data**
   - WhistlerPeak.com shows lift status and grooming updates quickly and in sync with the official source
   - This strongly suggests they are hitting a real, structured JSON feed ‚Äî likely the same one Epic uses internally

### ‚úÖ **The Real Solution**

**WhistlerPeak is almost certainly using reverse-engineered endpoints** (from the My Epic app or WhistlerBlackcomb.com) and **NOT scraping HTML**.

They probably:
1. **Captured Epic app traffic** using a proxy (Charles Proxy, mitmproxy)
2. **Found structured JSON endpoints**
3. **Built a backend script** to pull the data and cache it
4. **Display it on their site** from their own API

### üöÄ **Implementation Plan**

Instead of scraping `whistlerpeak.com`, we need to:

1. **Reverse-engineer the Epic app** to find the JSON endpoints
2. **Use tools like Charles Proxy or mitmproxy** to capture the actual API calls
3. **Hit those endpoints directly** (like WhistlerPeak does)

This would give us:
- ‚úÖ **Reliable, structured data**
- ‚úÖ **No IP blocking** (we're hitting the same endpoints as the official app)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates**
- ‚úÖ **Consistent with official data**

### üìù **User Requirements**

- **NO FALLBACK DATA** - app is completely useless without real data
- **Live data that refreshes every 7 minutes**
- **Accurate lift status** - only show open for lifts that are open, closed for lifts that are closed
- **21 lifts total** regardless of season
- **Real-time from Whistler Blackcomb site**

### üîÑ **Next Steps**

1. Set up Charles Proxy or mitmproxy
2. Capture Epic app traffic while viewing lift status
3. Identify the JSON endpoints being called
4. Implement direct API calls to those endpoints
5. Build caching layer for 7-minute refresh cycle

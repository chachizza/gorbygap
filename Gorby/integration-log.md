## üéØ Integration Principles

Based on `.cursorrules`:
- **No mock data** - All integrations must use live, real-time data
- **Reliability first** - Double-check all data retrieval and parsing
- **Documentation required** - All integrations must be documented here
- **Consistency** - Follow established design patterns and color schemes
